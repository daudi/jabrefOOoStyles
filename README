I am attempting to start a collection of style files for the JabRef OpenOffice plugin.
This is at a very early stage of development at the moment. 

Notes:
1. Use \format{} to deal with {} and \& etc. i.e. latex code that needs to be converted.
2. When you update the nameformatter you need to restart jabref for the changes to take effect.
3. You can change the style file without having to restart jabref.
